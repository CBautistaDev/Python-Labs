'''Both for loops and while loops can be used to count a specific number of loop iterations. 
A for loop combined with range() is generally preferred over while loops, since for loops are
 less likely to become stuck in an infinite loop situation. A programmer may easily forget to
  increment a while loop's variable (causing an infinite loop), but for loops iterate over a finite number 
  of elements in a container and are thus guaranteed to complete. '''


'''while is prefferesed when the numbe of iterations is not known before the loop`'''
'''for loop is used when the number of iterations is knwnw'''
